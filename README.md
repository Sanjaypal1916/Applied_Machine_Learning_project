# Applied Machine learning 

There is a huge difference between just creating the machine learning models using a jupyter notebook and creating a whole industry grade Machine learning workflow that can be executed with time. Applied Machine learning is the process where you get to learn about how the Machine learning models are actually created and the workflow is set as such that the same workflow can be used in the later periods to get the work done on the same type of data.

## Learning Documentation 

Today is the day 1 of me learning Applied machine learning and it is really fun for me to understand about the shuffle theory that before doing the folds in the data it is needed to be shuffled and genuinely this learning was the most crucial and has added value to my leanrings.
